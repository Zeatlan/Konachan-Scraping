# Konachan Scraping

This is a CLI tool to scrape data from Konachan. His main purpose is to download and compress automatically all images from a given artist.

## Installation
Just install the packages with
```
npm install
```

Then
```
npm run start
```

(In the future, I will add some possible configurations, like the output folder for the images, switch to R18 / G... Everything will be configurable in the CLI).

## Usage
Just run the application on a terminal, and give the name of an artist (replace spaces with `_`) and it will automatically do the rest.

`artists` folder is where your images will be stored.
